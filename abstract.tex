One of the key steps in quantum algorithms is to prepare an initial quantum superposition state with different kinds of features. These so-called \emph{state preparation} algorithms are essential to the behavior of quantum algorithms, and complicated state preparation algorithms are difficult to program correctly and effectively.
This paper presents QSV: a high-assurance framework implemented with the Rocq proof assistant, permitting the development of quantum state preparation programs and validating them to correctly reflect quantum program behaviors.
The key in the framework is to reduce the program correctness assurance of a program containing a quantum superposition state to the program correctness assurance for the program state without superposition.
The reduction allows the development of \textit{an effective framework for validating quantum state preparation algorithm implementations on a classical computer} --- considered a hard problem with no clear solution until this point.
We utilize the QuickChick property-based testing framework to validate state preparation programs.
We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach over 5 case studies implemented using QSV; such cases are not even simulatable in the current quantum simulators.
